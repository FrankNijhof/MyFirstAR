# My first AR

This is an assignment from Saxion from my course "Human Machine Interaction". The purpose is to get a feel how AR works.

### This is the way (how to play)
Download the app <a href="https://github.com/FrankNijhof/MyFirstAR/raw/master/AR%20Mobile.apk">here<a/>.

There are two images possible to scan:
- A book cover
- A mario card


#### the book cover
